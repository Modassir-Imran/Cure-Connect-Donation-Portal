          <h2>Emergency Response & DISASTER RELIEF</h2>
          <br> <br>
          <p>Our team along with volunteers and doctors are always first to respond to natural or manmade disasters, with principal response efforts focused on food, shelter, water, health and sanitation. We reached out to far off villages during 2013 Uttarakhand floods with emergency relief.  Uday Foundation worked to provide emergency relief materials such as food, shelter, water, sanitation and emergency supplies to the victims. Similarly, during 2014 Kashmir floods, in collaboration with Jammu and Kashmir Police and various other government and non government agencies, cureThem provided emergency relief material to the flood victims. We also conducted medical camps and distributed immediate relief material  for the victims of Jammu and Kashmir Floods, Chennai Floods, Kerala Floods, Assam and Bihar Floods and most recently on coronavirus pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>We also conduct regular health camps for homeless and underprivileged who find it difficult to reach the hospital. These health camps have been organised in different parts of North India, our camps covering population from remote villages to provide free primary health care and medicine services. We have already held numerous free medical camps in Delhi NCR, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Haryana.</p>
          <p>Apart from financial contribution, a large number of individuals, organizations, institutions and corporations provided us in-kind help including clothes, dry ration, medicines, utensils, blankets  and dignity kits. We have a dedicated collection centre, where individuals visit to donate different kinds of materials. </p>

          <h2>HELP THE HOMELESS PATIENTS AWAITING TREATMENT. UNSURE OF NEXT MEAL, WITHOUT DECENT CLOTHES AND BASIC SANITATION</h2>
          <br> <br>
          <p>Everyday thousands of poor patients come to Delhi for medical treatment. Apart from the medical treatment they face an everyday struggle for food, water and lodging. Majority of these patients remain in critical condition as their healthcare needs can no longer be met at a state or district level.</p>
          <p>Since most of them are migrant patients with very limited funds, a new and unknown city like Delhi does not provide a stay which is economic, food that is hygienic and nutritious and other basic necessities become a luxury.</p>
          <p>Lacs of poor patients and caregivers spend harsh winter or cruel summer on Delhi streets. These people remain malnourished, with lack of access to basic necessities, such as food, water and clothes.  They always remain exposed to extreme weather conditions – heat or cold. They always work through extremely harsh hot afternoons without assured access to water, food and shelter. The summer heat aggravates their fragile physical condition. Failing to cope up with intense heat & cold and it’s ill-effects, the number of deaths of homeless people is rising at an alarming rate.</p>
          <p>As a society we face a lot of social problems today, but sadly we don’t have enough listeners. We feel there are a lot of people crying out for our help. In our capacity, we are trying our bit to support some of them and will continue to do so.  </p>
